# Code of Conduct
All org members should familiarize themselves with this document to better understand the expectations for behavior when communicating and interacting with members. In addition, community members are expected to adhere to guidelines as outlined on communication channels (Terms of Service).

## Mission Statement
As a community of diverse individuals, the org prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We are committed to providing a harassment-free environment regardless of gender and gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion or lack thereof.

## Scope
The code of conduct applies to all members of the org in all spaces and situations where multiple members of the the org are present including—but not limited to—pull requests, Discord, Zoom, Slack, and other physical and online communication channels.

## Violations
The org makes the distinction between incidents that are teachable and non-teachable.

### Teachable Offenses
These incidents are teachable moments made without the intent to harm, but are nonetheless offensive. If the offensive party is willing to learn, we are willing to work with that.

* Comments based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion that offend an individual or group. This includes deprecated words that harm members of our community and go against our goal of creating an inclusive space. For a good list of words please reference [Self-Defined](https://www.selfdefined.app/) by [Tatiana Mac](https://twitter.com/tatianatmac)

* Unwanted comments based on someone's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment.
* Playing 'Devil's Advocate', justifying, or otherwise equivocating when being confronted about harmful behavior. A willingness to change and a mind for learning more is the only acceptable response.
* Disruptive behavior during discussions or other forms of communication.

### Non-teachable Offenses

These are deliberate infringements on peoples’ rights, freedoms, and safety.

* A pattern of the same offensive behavior listed in the teachable offenses after the incident has been addressed and mediation has been provided.

* Purposeful misgendering including use of 'dead' or rejected names.

* Inappropriate sexual images, behavior, advances, or communication that assumes inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.

* Non-consensual physical and simulated contact without consent and after a request to stop.

* Violent threats, including encouragement toward suicide or self-harm.

* Purposeful intimidation.

* Stalking, unwanted following, or continued communication after a request to stop.

* Unsolicited use of photography or video for the purposes of blackmail or stalking.

* Intentional outing of an individual's identity without their consent except where it is necessary to protect a vulnerable individual from abuse.

* Publishing content that was meant to be held in confidence, except where that content violates the terms listed here (both teachable and non-teachable) or is otherwise harmful to others.

## Enforcement of the Code of Conduct

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

They will follow the Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct.

<div  align="center"><b> Community Impact Guidelines</b></div>

### 1. Moderation

**Community Impact**: Microagressions.

**Consequence**: Handle the grievance personally between the two parties involved, or request a third party to moderate the discussion.

### 2. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. Discussion and review of the Code of Conduct will be required.

### 3. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels such as social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 4. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 5. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Review Process

When an incident is reported to the org, the community must first determine how the behavior violates the code of conduct. In the event that a behavior, or a pattern of repeated behavior, is found to be in violation of the code of conduct, the members will take a voluntary, private vote on the consequence(s) through an appropriate communication channel no later than one week following the determination.

* In the event of a tie, members may discuss next steps.

## How can I report offences?

Conduct should be addressed, not ignored. The org is moderated on a voluntary basis. Report an incident to a community moderator via the Discord channel. Be sure to include the name of the individual, the date of the incident, a description of the incident, and the code you believe was violated. You may be asked to provide evidence of the incident.

Please note, we do not consider the following as offensive behavior:

- 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.

- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you".

- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial.

- The act of criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

## How can I make an appeal?
Submit a written appeal no later than three days after a determination has been made on the consequence. Describe the incident and why you believe it does not violate the code of conduct or the otherwise extenuating circumstances surrounding the incident.

## Positive Contributions
We also believe in the importance of highlighting positive contributions in the organization. To that end, it's valuable to celebrate people's achievements and give credit where it's due. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

- Creating your first Pull Request!
