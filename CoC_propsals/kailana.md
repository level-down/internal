## Mission Statement
As a community of diverse individuals, the org prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We are committed to providing a harassment-free environment regardless of gender and gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion or lack thereof.
 
## Who does this document apply to?
The code of conduct applies to all members of the org.
 
## When and where does it apply?
The code of conduct applies "in all spaces and situations where the org is present" including—but not limited to—pull requests, Discord, Zoom, Slack, and other physical and online communication channels.
 
## Expectations for Behavior
All org members should familiarize themselves with this document to better understand the expectations for behavior when communicating and interacting with members. Community members are expected to adhere to guidelines as outlined on communication channels (terms of service).
 
## Violations
The org makes the distinction between incidents that are teachable and non-teachable.
 
### Teachable Offences
These incidents are teachable moments made without the intent to harm, but are nonetheless offensive. If the offensive party is willing to learn, we are willing to work with that.
 
* Comments based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion that offend an individual or group.
* Unwanted comments based on someone's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment.
* Disruptive behavior during discussions or other forms of communication.
 
### Non-teachable Offences
These are deliberate infringements on peoples’ rights, freedoms, and safety.
 
* A pattern of the same offensive behavior listed in the teachable offences after the incident has been addressed and mediation has been provided and an unwillingness to learn.
* Purposeful misgendering including use of 'dead' or rejected names.
* Inappropriate sexual images, behavior, and/or advances as well as contact that assumes inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Non-consensual physical and simulated contact without consent and after a request to stop.
* Violent threats.
* Threats of violences towards individuals, including encouragement toward suicide or self-harm.
* Purposeful intimidation.
* Stalking or unwanted following.
* Unsolicited use of photography or video for the purposes of blackmail or stalking.
* Continued communication with an individual after a request to stop.
* Intentional outing of an individual's identity without their consent except where it is necessary to protect a vulnerable individual from abuse.
* Publishing content that was meant to be held in confidence, except where that content violates the terms listed here (both teachable and non-teachable) or is otherwise harmful to others.
 
## Consequences
Teachable offences: voluntary mediation, discussion/review of the code of conduct, reassignment of duties.
 
Non-teachable offences: suspension or banning.
 
## Review Process
When an inciting incident is reported to the org, the community must first determine how the behavior violates the code of conduct. In the event that a behavior, or a pattern of repeated behavior, is found to be in violation of the code of conduct, the members will take a voluntary, private vote on the consequence(s) through an appropriate communication channel no later than one week following the determination.
* In the event of a tie, members may discuss next steps.
 
## How can I report offences?
Conduct should be addressed, not ignored. The org is moderated on a voluntary basis. Report an incident to a community moderator via the Discord channel. Be sure to include the name of the individual, the date of the incident, a description of the incident, and the code you believe was violated. You may be asked to provide evidence of the incident.
 
## How can I make an appeal?
Submit a written appeal no later than three days after a determination has been made on the consequence. Describe the incident and why you believe it does not violate the code of conduct or the otherwise extenuating circumstances surrounding the incident.
 
## Don't be afraid to report the positive
Did you or someone you know make a positive contribution to the project or otherwise? Please tell us about it. We'd love to hear it.
