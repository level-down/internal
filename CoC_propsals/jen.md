# Code of Conduct

## Our Mision

As a community of diverse individuals, the org prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We are committed to providing a harassment-free environment regardless of gender and gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion or lack thereof. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community.

## Our Standards

We believe good behavior should also be rewarded. If you see behavior that you believe should be rewarded and contributes to our mission of creating a harrassment-free space feel free to celebrate and tell us about it. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

-  Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
-  Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
-  Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
   and learning from the experience
-  Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
   overall community
-  Creating your first Pull Request!

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-  The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
   advances of any kind
-  Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-  Public or private harassment
-  Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
   address, without their explicit permission
-  Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
   professional setting

## Teachable vs. Non-teachable Offenses

The distinction between teachable and non-teachable offenses is very important and carry a different response from the organization leaderships.

### Teachable Offences

These incidents are teachable moments made without the intent to harm, but are nonetheless offensive. If the offensive party is willing to learn, we are willing to work with that.

-  Comments based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion that offend an individual or group.
   -  This includes deprecated words that harm members of our community and go against our goal of creating an inclusive space. For a good list of words please reference [Self-Defined](https://www.selfdefined.app/) by [Tatiana Mac](https://twitter.com/tatianatmac)
-  Unwanted comments based on someone's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment.
-  Disruptive behavior during discussions or other forms of communication.

### Non-teachable Offences

These are deliberate infringements on peoplesâ€™ rights, freedoms, and safety.

-  A pattern of the same offensive behavior listed in the teachable offences after the incident has been addressed and mediation has been provided and an unwillingness to learn.
-  Purposeful misgendering including use of 'dead' or rejected names.
-  Inappropriate sexual images, behavior, and/or advances as well as contact that assumes inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
-  Non-consensual physical and simulated contact without consent and after a request to stop.
-  Threats of violences towards individuals, including encouragement toward suicide or self-harm.
-  Purposeful intimidation.
-  Stalking or unwanted following.
-  Unsolicited use of photography or video for the purposes of blackmail or stalking.
-  Continued communication with an individual after a request to stop.
-  Intentional outing of an individual's identity without their consent except where it is necessary to protect a vulnerable individual from abuse.
-  Publishing content that was meant to be held in confidence, except where that content violates the terms listed here (both teachable and non-teachable) or is otherwise harmful to others.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces such as Discord, Slack, Zoom, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
