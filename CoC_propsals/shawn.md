# Code Of Conduct Input

## What is inappropriate behavior?

Behavior that makes others feel unsafe, marginalized or generally uncomfortable, these include all the things we discussed.
This can be added to later down the road as the group sees fit.

## Categories

### Levels of Inappropriateness

- Severe: Basically anything that isn't a micro aggression (reference the code of conduct Lucy provided)
- Minor: Micro-Aggressions

### Types of Behavioral Negligence

- Knowingly negligent: There is no tolerance if
  1) someone partakes in minor inappropriate behavior repeatedly (more than twice).
  2) someone partakes in behavior that is severely inappropriate.
- Unknowingly negligent: There is tolerance (to a degree) if someone unintentionally partakes in inappropriate behavior.

### Where it Applies

- Your interactions with the group through any medium (e.g the discord channel, a meeting)
- Your interactions outside of the group (e.g on social media)

## Moderation

If someone behaves inappropriately, the affected party gets to decide to:
1) Handle the grievance personally with the person in violation --> either gets resolved or moved to moderation
2) Bring in a third party (uninvolved person(s)) to moderate a discussion --> gets resolved
