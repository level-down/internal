# Code of Conduct

Proposal by Alisa

## Guiding Principle

Our organization prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. Therefore, we will not act on complaints regarding:

- 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you".
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial.
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

## Teachable versus Non-Teachable Offenses

Our organization believes there is a difference between a teachable and non-teachable incidents. **Teachable** incidents are those where the offensive party is willing to learn, and we're willing to work with that. **Non-teachable** incidents are those that are deliberate infringements on peoplesâ€™ rights and safety.

### List of offenses

#### Teachable offenses

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Sustained disruption of discussion

#### Non-teachable offenses

- Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

## Enforcement of the Code of Conduct

If someone commits a non-teachable offense and/or expresses a refusal to correct or apologize for their mistake, we, as an organization, have the ability to decide what the consequences are. Consequences may include removing the member from the group. To decide on the consequences, members will be able to have a private vote on the situation. In the event of a tie, members will meet to discuss the events and come to a consensus.

If someone commits a teachable offense, other members should, on a voluntary basis, enter into a discussion with those involved, as mediators. We believe that **conduct should be addressed, not ignored**.

## Where Does The Code of Conduct Apply?

The Code of Conduct applies in all spaces where the organization is present. This includes, but is not limited to, Discord messages (both in the group and directly), video meetings, pull requests, and in-person interactions.

The question of whether the Code of Conduct applies to external places that do not directly involve members of the group will be up for future discussion.

## Positive Contributions

We also believe in the importance of highlighting positive contributions in the organization. To that end, it's valuable to celebrate people's achievements and give credit where it's due.
