# Code of Conduct


## Guiding Principle

Our organization prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. Therefore, we will not act on complaints regarding:

- 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you".
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial.
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

## Teachable versus Non-Teachable Offenses

Our organization believes there is a difference between a teachable and non-teachable incidents. **Teachable** incidents are those where the offensive party is willing to learn, and we're willing to work with that. **Non-teachable** incidents are those that are deliberate infringements on peoplesâ€™ rights and safety.

## List of offenses

### Teachable Offenses

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.

## Application of CoC guidelines
* The guiding principles* are to be upheld in all spaces internally, and externally.


## Filing an incident
* (Google) Form to file: select members involved, describe incident, provide "evidence" if applicable
* Pick a moderation commitee of individuals not involved (think jury duty)
    * With this style we don't need a rotating moderator group, and we can gaurantee that individuals involved in the incident aren't apart of the review process.
